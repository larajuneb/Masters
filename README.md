This repository contains all code developed in order to analyse all data collected throughout the course of the Masters thesis.
The Plant object respresents a plant in the experiment, with all attributes populated based on the data collected. This will hopefully all be based off of a database that will be developed to organise all data in a logical fasion.
The data includes agronomic readings, porometer readings, and eventually will include gene expression data.
